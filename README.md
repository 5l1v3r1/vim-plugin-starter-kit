# vim-plugin-starter-kit

## Get productive a little faster

I created the vim-plugin-starter-kit to help speed up development and perhaps shorten the learning curve
involved with writing Vim plugins.

## Installation

`pip install scaffold-vim-plugin`

## Usage

Run `scaffold-vim-plugin` from the command line. Once you answer a few questions you will have all
that you need to immediately get started writing a new Vim plugin with the Python language. The
resulting directory will contain scaffolding for documentation, testing, and your .py and .vim files
customized for your specified project name. The files will contain working examples you can use as
reference as you begin writing your plugin.

## Wiki

As you're are getting started check out the [Wiki](wiki) for more examples of usage of common interactions
between Python scripts with the Vim buffer.

# vim-plugin-starter-kit

## Get productive a little faster

I created the vim-plugin-starter-kit to help speed up development and perhaps shorten the learning curve involved with writing Vim plugins.

## Usage

Clone this repo and run the `create_plugin_scaffold.py` script. Once you answer a few questions and you will have all the you need to immediately get
started writing a new Vim plugin with the Python language. The resulting directory will contain scaffolding for documentation, testing, and your .py and .vim files customized for your specified project name.
The files will contain working examples you can use as reference as you begin writing your plugin.

## Wiki

As your are getting started check out the wikiLinkHere for more examples of usage of common interactions of Python scripts with the Vim buffer.
